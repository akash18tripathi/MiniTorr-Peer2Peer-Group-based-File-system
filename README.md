# MiniTorr-Peer2Peer-Group-based-File-system
This project is a peer-to-peer file sharing network that enables users to share, download, and remove files from the group they belong to. Download happens parallelly with multiple pieces from multiple peers. It follows a similar concept to popular file sharing protocols like BitTorrent found on the internet.
